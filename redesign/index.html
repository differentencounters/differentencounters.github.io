					<p>Different Encounters (“DE”) is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the development of under-resourced, pre-adolescent youth in New York City. Through a basketball curriculum, DE positive engages young men in learning about themselves through education in a weekly, out-of-school atmosphere. This engagement will lead to better informed, more responsible young people who are ready to take on life, but more than that, ready to <span class="underline">influence the next generation of young people through service leadership.</span></p>

					<p>Ray Fredrick has been a NYC physical education teacher for over three years. Ray, a 9-year army veteran, has spent most of his time teaching in Upper Manhattan. He is concerned.</p>

					<p>Due to a multitude of reasons, there is a lack of fundamental values amongst a large portion of young men living in troubled neighborhoods in New York City. There is a lack of:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Educational Focus</li>
						<li>Community and Familial Responsibility</li>
						<li>Respect and Self-Respect</li>
					</ul>

					<p>There are few public and private organizations in NYC (particularly that can deliver a resonating message) to address these evident and ever-growing issues.</p>

					<p>Ray Fredrick and Andrey Yoffe are dedicating their time, effort and money to teach and guide young men towards the core fundamentals of <strong>responsibility</strong>, <strong>community service leadership</strong>, <strong>education</strong> and <strong>family</strong> in an environment that facilitates the delivery of the message.</p>
