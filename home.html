  <p class="intro">Different Encounters (“DE”) is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the development of under-resourced, pre-adolescent youth in New York City. Through a basketball curriculum, DE positive engages young men in learning about themselves through education in a weekly, out-of-school atmosphere. This engagement will lead to better informed, more responsible young people who are ready to take on life, but more than that, ready to <span class="underline">influence the next generation of young people through service leadership.</span></p>

  <p>With its inaugural year in 2013 at the Mosaic Preparatory Academy, the Different Encounters program blends (i) physical education, (ii) character education and (iii) health education to provide students with guidance and support that will help them at school, at home and in their communities.</p>

      <strong>By the 2017-18 school year,</strong> the DE program will be held at various schools around East Harlem, focusing on young men <strong>and young women from fifth grade through eighth grade.</strong> The Boys’ program will continue to focus on basketball, while the new Girls’ program will focus on Blend (team jump-roping). Scrimmages and tournaments will be introduced. Most importantly, older students will be ‘buddied’ with younger students <strong>as part of a mentorship program. Older students will also take on coaching and other senior roles.</strong>
