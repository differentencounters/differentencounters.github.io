					<p>Directed Energy (DE) is a new not-for-profit organization dedicated to the development of under-resourced, pre-adolescent youth in New York City.</p>

					<p>Through a team sports curriculum, DE positively engages our young people in learning about themselves through education in a weekly, out-of-school atmosphere. This engagement will lead to better informed, more responsible young people who are ready to take on life, but more than that, ready to influence the next generation of young people through service leadership.</p>

					<p>Ray Fredrick and Andrey Yoffe founded Directed Energy in 2013 to positively influence young men and women living in troubled neighborhoods in New York City.</p>

					<p>We are dedicating the time, focus and resources to teach and guide young people towards the core fundamentals of <span class="orange">(i)</span> Responsiblity, <span class="orange">(ii)</span> Community Service Leadership, <span class="orange">(iii)</span> Education and <span class="orange">(iv)</span> Family in an environment that facilitates and sharpens the delivery of the message.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Educational Focus</li>
						<li>Community and Familial Responsibility</li>
						<li>Respect and Self-Respect</li>
					</ul>

					<p>There are few public and private organizations in NYC (particularly that can deliver a resonating message) to address these evident and ever-growing issues.</p>

					<p>Ray Fredrick and Andrey Yoffe are dedicating their time, effort and money to teach and guide young men towards the core fundamentals of <strong>responsibility</strong>, <strong>community service leadership</strong>, <strong>education</strong> and <strong>family</strong> in an environment that facilitates the delivery of the message.</p>

					<p>There are few organizations that address these fundamental values in our young people. Please find more details on the Directed Energy program.</p>
