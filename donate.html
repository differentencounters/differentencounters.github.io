<p>No donation is too small to help us expand the Different Encounters program to dozens of schools in NYC and nationwide. We have funded the program out of our own pockets since the program's inception in 2013 and will continue to donate as much as is necessary to make a true difference in the lives of promising young men and students who need the increased guidance and attention to reach their potential in school and in their communities. </p>
